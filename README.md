# Open Data Node

## Intro

TODO

## Documentation

As part of [COMSODE project](http://www.comsode.eu/), we're taking ideas from
[old Open Data Node](http://opendata.sk/liferay/open-data-node), existing
[UnifiedViews](https://github.com/UnifiedViews/) and we will put together new
Open Data Node.

Documentation will be located in following places (ordered based on
impotance and preference):

1. source code tree on GitHub: https://github.com/OpenDataNode/open-data-node
2. wiki on GitHub: https://github.com/OpenDataNode/open-data-node/wiki
3. Open Data Node in OpenData.sk Wiki: https://utopia.sk/wiki/display/ODN/

To make sure code matches documentation, having it together with source code
is good.  If that is not feasible for some reason, the next best thing is
wiki on GitHub.  Even if that is not feasible, you can use space in
OpenData.sk's Confluence Wiki.
