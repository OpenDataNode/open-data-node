## Intro

[Open Data Node](http://opendatanode.org/) (ODN in short) is open source platform
supporting entire process of publication, management and exchange of Open Data.
For more information, please visit: http://opendatanode.org/

For initial introduction of what Open Data Node is (or is supposed to be) please
read [a post on COMSODE blog](http://www.comsode.eu/index.php/2014/06/open-data-node-what-it-is-what-it-does-what-is-next/).

## Documentation

As part of [COMSODE project](http://www.comsode.eu/), we've taken ideas
from [old Open Data Node](http://opendata.sk/liferay/open-data-node),
existing [UnifiedViews](https://github.com/UnifiedViews/)
and we are putting together new Open Data Node.

Documentation is located in following places (ordered based on impotance and preference):

1. Home page: http://opendatanode.org/
2. Source code tree on GitHub: https://github.com/OpenDataNode/open-data-node
3. Open Data Node in OpenData.sk Wiki: https://utopia.sk/wiki/display/ODN/

To make sure code matches documentation, having it together with source code is preferable.
If that is not feasible for some reason, the next best thing is ODN space in OpenData.sk's Confluence Wiki.
